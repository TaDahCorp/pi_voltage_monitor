# pi_voltage_monitor
Voltage monitor and logger for the Raspberry Pi

The purpose is to get more info on the lighting bolt or message appearing on the monitor.
Of if headless, to see when it occurs.

This quick utility helps in tracking down power adapters or USB cables that are insufficient for the Pi.
Or, as external devices, bonnets, hats, shims and other devices are added to view when power is insufficient.

Runs continuously in a terminal or SSH of a Raspberry Pi.
Optionally log to a CSV file and see when low voltage situations occurs.

It also reports on throttling and temperature.
